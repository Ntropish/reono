# Reono Scenario-Based Integration Testing Plan

## Project Overview

**Reono** has completed all core functionality and utility components. Before finalizing documentation, we need to validate that all components work together seamlessly in realistic, complex scenarios that mirror real-world API development challenges.

### Completed Components Available for Integration

- âœ… **Core Runtime**: Enhanced ApiContext, standard schema support, all HTTP methods
- âœ… **Guard**: Conditional access control with static/dynamic conditions
- âœ… **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing with automatic OPTIONS handling
- âœ… **Transform**: Request/response transformation middleware
- âœ… **Static**: Secure static file serving with directory traversal protection
- âœ… **RateLimit**: In-memory rate limiting with configurable policies
- âœ… **FileUpload**: File validation, size limits, MIME type restrictions

### Testing Philosophy

**Scenario-based integration testing** focuses on realistic use cases that combine multiple components to validate:

- Component composition and interaction
- Middleware execution order and state sharing
- Error handling across component boundaries
- Performance under realistic load patterns
- Type safety and developer experience

## Selected Integration Scenarios

### ðŸŽ¯ **Scenario 1: Content Management API with File Uploads**

**Complexity**: Medium  
**Focus**: FileUpload + Guard + RateLimit + CORS + Transform

**Real-world context**: A blog/CMS API that handles authenticated content creation with image uploads, rate limiting for abuse prevention, and CORS for frontend integration.

**Key Features to Test**:

- Multi-component middleware stacking
- Authentication flow with Guard component
- File upload validation and processing
- Rate limiting by user/endpoint
- CORS preflight handling
- Request/response transformation
- Error propagation through middleware chain

**API Endpoints**:

```tsx
// POST /api/content/articles (with optional image uploads)
// GET /api/content/articles/:id
// PUT /api/content/articles/:id (with optional image updates)
// DELETE /api/content/articles/:id
// POST /api/content/images (standalone image upload)
// GET /uploads/* (static file serving)
```

**Technical Challenges**:

- Authenticated file uploads with size/type validation
- Different rate limits for different user tiers
- Image processing and transformation
- Proper CORS configuration for file uploads
- State sharing between Guard and other components

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Scenario 2: Multi-Tenant SaaS API Gateway**

**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Focus**: Guard + RateLimit + Transform + CORS + Static

**Real-world context**: A SaaS platform API that serves multiple tenants with different access levels, rate limits, and response transformations based on subscription tiers.

**Key Features to Test**:

- Complex nested Guard conditions (tenant + user + subscription)
- Tiered rate limiting (free vs premium users)
- Dynamic response transformation based on user context
- API versioning with backwards compatibility
- Static documentation serving
- Cross-origin requests from multiple domains

**API Endpoints**:

```tsx
// /api/v1/tenant/:tenantId/users
// /api/v1/tenant/:tenantId/analytics
// /api/v1/tenant/:tenantId/billing
// /api/v2/tenant/:tenantId/* (newer version)
// /docs/* (static API documentation)
// /health (public endpoint)
```

**Technical Challenges**:

- Tenant isolation through Guard conditions
- Dynamic rate limiting based on subscription tier
- Response filtering based on user permissions
- API key validation and tenant resolution
- Version-specific CORS policies

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Scenario 3: Real-time Gaming Leaderboard API**

**Complexity**: Medium  
**Focus**: RateLimit + Guard + Transform + Static + CORS

**Real-world context**: A gaming API that handles high-frequency score submissions, leaderboard queries, and serves game assets with aggressive rate limiting and real-time data transformation.

**Key Features to Test**:

- High-frequency request handling
- Aggressive rate limiting with burst allowances
- Real-time score validation and transformation
- Static game asset serving with caching
- WebSocket preparation (CORS for upgrade)
- Anti-cheat validation through Guard

**API Endpoints**:

```tsx
// POST /api/game/scores (high frequency)
// GET /api/game/leaderboard/:gameId
// GET /api/game/player/:playerId/stats
// GET /api/game/player/:playerId/achievements
// GET /assets/game/* (static game files)
// GET /api/game/matches/:matchId
```

**Technical Challenges**:

- Sub-second rate limiting for score submissions
- Score validation and anti-cheat detection
- Leaderboard data transformation and aggregation
- Static asset serving with proper caching headers
- High concurrency and performance testing

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Scenario 1 Implementation (Current Focus)

**Target**: Content Management API with File Uploads

**Step 1: Core API Structure**

- Design the content/article data model
- Implement basic CRUD operations
- Set up authentication simulation

**Step 2: Component Integration**

- Add FileUpload for image handling
- Implement Guard for authentication
- Configure RateLimit for abuse prevention
- Enable CORS for frontend integration
- Add Transform for response formatting

**Step 3: Advanced Features**

- Multiple file uploads per article
- Image processing and validation
- User-based rate limiting
- Error handling across all components

**Step 4: Integration Testing**

- Full request lifecycle testing
- Component interaction validation
- Error boundary testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Test Coverage Goals

**Functional Testing**:

- âœ… All components work together without conflicts
- âœ… Middleware execution order is correct
- âœ… State is properly shared between components
- âœ… Error handling works across component boundaries
- âœ… Type safety is maintained throughout the stack

**Performance Testing**:

- âœ… Request latency with full middleware stack
- âœ… Memory usage with complex component trees
- âœ… Concurrent request handling
- âœ… Rate limiting effectiveness under load

**Integration Testing**:

- âœ… Real HTTP requests through full middleware chain
- âœ… File upload with validation and rate limiting
- âœ… CORS preflight with complex middleware
- âœ… Authentication flow with multiple protected endpoints

## Success Criteria

### For Each Scenario:

1. **Full Integration**: All utility components work together seamlessly
2. **Realistic Complexity**: Tests mirror real-world API development challenges
3. **Performance Validation**: Acceptable latency and memory usage
4. **Error Robustness**: Graceful handling of edge cases and failures
5. **Developer Experience**: Clean, readable code with proper TypeScript inference

### Overall Goals:

- **Component Composition**: Validate that components can be nested and combined arbitrarily
- **Middleware Order**: Confirm that middleware execution order is predictable and configurable
- **State Management**: Ensure proper context state sharing between components
- **Production Readiness**: Verify the library is ready for real-world deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Scenario 1**: Start with Content Management API
2. **Create Integration Test Suite**: Comprehensive testing framework
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics
4. **Documentation**: Based on validated real-world usage patterns
5. **Scenario 2 & 3**: Expand to additional complexity levels

This approach will provide confidence that Reono is production-ready and give us concrete examples for documentation and best practices guides.
